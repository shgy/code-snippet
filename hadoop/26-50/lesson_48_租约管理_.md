从代码中摘录出来的
```
   * A Lease governs all the locks held by a single client.
   * For each client there's a corresponding lease, whose
   * timestamp is updated when the client periodically
   * checks in.  If the client dies and allows its lease to
   * expire, all the corresponding locks can be released.
```

```
    /** Only LeaseManager object can create a lease */
    /** Only LeaseManager object can renew a lease */

```

```
 * LeaseManager does the lease housekeeping(经营，管理) for writing on files.
 * This class also provides useful static methods for lease recovery.
 *
 * Lease Recovery Algorithm
 * 1) Namenode retrieves lease information
 * 2) For each file f in the lease, consider the last block b of f
 * 2.1) Get the datanodes which contains b
 * 2.2) Assign one of the datanodes as the primary datanode p

 * 2.3) p obtains a new generation stamp from the namenode
 * 2.4) p gets the block info from each datanode
 * 2.5) p computes the minimum block length
 * 2.6) p updates the datanodes, which have a valid generation stamp,
 *      with the new generation stamp and the minimum block length
 * 2.7) p acknowledges the namenode the update results

 * 2.8) Namenode updates the BlockInfo
 * 2.9) Namenode removes f from the lease
 *      and removes the lease once all files have been removed
 * 2.10) Namenode commit changes to edit log
