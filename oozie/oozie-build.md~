问题1: 
Failed to execute goal on project oozie-core: Could not resolve dependencies for project org.apache.oozie:oozie-core:jar:4.2.0: Could not transfer artifact org.apache.hbase:hbase:jar:1.1.1 from/to Codehaus repository (http://repository.codehaus.org/): Unknown host repository.codehaus.org

The Codehaus hosting platform was ended, i.e., their public Maven repository is gone, too. You should try to follow their advice and add the following to your ~/.m2/settings.xml file:

<repositories>
     <repository>
       <id>Codehaus repository</id>
       <name>codehaus-mule-repo</name>
       <url>https://repository-master.mulesoft.org/nexus/content/groups/public/
       </url>
       <layout>default</layout>
     </repository>
   </repositories>
This should use a backup repository to get the missing dependency.
